        "1. Collect and preprocess the data: Collect the webpages that need to be classified and preprocess them to extract the relevant information. This may involve cleaning the text data, removing stop words, and transforming the data into a format that can be used by pycaret.\n",
        "1. Load the data into a pandas DataFrame: Load the preprocessed data into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "1. Split the data into training and testing sets: Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from sklearn.model_selection.\n",
        "1. Set up the pycaret environment: Initialize the pycaret environment and load the data using the setup() function. This function automatically preprocesses the data and prepares it for modeling.\n",
        "1. Train and compare multiple models: Train multiple classification models using the compare_models() function. This function automatically trains and evaluates several models and selects the best one based on performance metrics.\n",
        "1. Tune the selected model: Use the tune_model() function to fine-tune the selected model and improve its performance.\n",
        "1. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the final model on the testing set using the evaluate_model() function.\n",
        "1. Use the model to classify new data: Once the final model is trained and evaluated, use it to classify new webpages using the predict_model() function.\n",
        "1. Save the model: Save the trained model to a file using the save_model() function so that it can be reused later.\n",
        "1. Deploy the model: Deploy the trained model in a production environment and use it to classify webpages as needed."
